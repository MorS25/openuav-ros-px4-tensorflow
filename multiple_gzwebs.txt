How to Set up multiple GZservers Steps

Note ansible does this all for you except step 3

1. Create docker image with gzweb/gazebo. Either copy an existing one or open the image and download gzweb/gazebo. It is important when you run the container that you specify a couple ports for the outside server to use. These ports MUST be different from other containers. No ports need to be exposed
	1. a port for output
	2. a port for input
here is an example:
sudo docker run -dit -p 82:82 -p 71:71 openuav-tf-gzweb bash
port 82 is my output
port 71 is my input

2. In order for gzweb to use these port a couple files inside the container need to be edited.
	a. Edit gzweb/http/client/gz3d.js line 2222. Replace 7681 with your input port (in the above example I used 71)
	b. Edit gzweb/gzbridge/ws_server.js line 37 and 38. Replace 7681 with your input port (again, mine would be 71)

3. Run gzweb. To test go to the gzweb directory, and run ./start_gzweb.sh -p <your-output-port> && gzserver. 
	Example:
	$ ./start_gzweb.sh -p 82 && gzserver

4. In the host open up localhost:outputport. E.g localhost:82

Done!
